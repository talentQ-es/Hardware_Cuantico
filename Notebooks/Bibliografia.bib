One of these terms is present at zero voltage and represents a supercurrent which can cross such barriers as thin layers of insulator or normal metal; the other is an extra component of resistive current. The review sets out sufficient theoretical background to allow readers with no previous knowledge of superconductivity to understand the basic physics of the effects. It also caters for those wishing to learn enough to understand devices based on Josephson effects. The article concentrates on fundamentals, and early and recent experimental and theoretical developments in the understanding of Josephson weak links of all types are emphasized.}

First proposed in the 1980s as a way to improve computational modeling of quantum systems, the field of quantum computing has recently garnered significant attention due to progress in building small-scale devices. However, significant technical advances will be required before a large-scale, practical quantum computer can be achieved.\nQuantum Computing: Progress and Prospects provides an introduction to the field, including the unique characteristics and constraints of the technology, and assesses the feasibility and implications of creating a functional quantum computer capable of addressing real-world problems. This report considers hardware and software requirements, quantum algorithms, drivers of advances in quantum computing and quantum devices, benchmarks associated with relevant use cases, the time and resources required, and how to assess the probability of success.",
